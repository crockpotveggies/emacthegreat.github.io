    <h1>Elyssa Macfarlane</h1>
    <p>Born in North Vancouver, Macfarlane has had a knack for media and politics since she began taking her first PoliSci class at Simon Fraser University. When she's not using her free time to catch up on the latest reading, Macfarlane is managing communications for a Vancouver FinTech company and representing the Federal Liberal Party of Canada.</p>

    <p>Elyssa is a sweetheart, and is one of the most beautiful people I know. When she's not getting herself in trouble with her quick assumptions, Macfarlane glistens like the morning sun striking the morning dew.</p>
