    <h1>Elyssa Macfarlane</h1>
    <p>Hello and welcome!</p>

<p>I’m a communications professional turned software engineer that loves writing and has a knack for facing adversity. I traded in writing press releases for coding python because I felt the need to get back to using the other side of my brain. I’ve pitched and delivered to major outlets across Canada on a variety of major stories that helped to shape multiple conversations in Vancouver’s tech scene, and now I’m working in the construction of the technology itself.</p>

<p>Born and raised in Vancouver, I found it easy to become enamoured with politics, finance and tech. When I’m not coding or writing, I’m typically doing something in politics or riding my bike around the city.</p>

<p>I originally started this website to help me in my journey of self-education where I had a space to write about the topics I really care about: life, dealing with stupid people, research, great articles/books, self-awareness, learning and, of course, interesting technology. Meditations on Tech and Media is a product of me searching for a space that represented these conversations and, because I couldn’t find it, I ended up creating this space myself.</p>
